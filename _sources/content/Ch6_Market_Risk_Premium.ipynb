    "I would argue that there is no obvious answer and in fact no \"right\" answer. It clearly depends on your personal preferences, but perhaps we can build a framework for how one could think about this opportunity. The first step is to establish the *bounds* for the bet: what is the least you would be willing to pay and the most. The least you would be willing to pay is $50 because you are guaranteed to win at least this much and the maximum you would be willing to pay is $150 because this is the most you could possibly win. Unfortunately, there is still a rather large gap of uncertainty regarding the amount to pay. \n",
